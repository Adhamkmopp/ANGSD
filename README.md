# ANGSD :: Bioinformatics Project I,
## <u> Extending the ANGSD summary statistics, 2017, University of Copenhagen </u> 
### Course Description

This was a course in learning C++ through extending the [ANGDS](https://github.com/ANGSD/angsd); an open source multi-threaded program for generating summary statistics of NGS data. The only modifications are in abcSum where summary statistics were extended to include distributions of raw base count and ratio by depth, base quality scores by depth and allowing the user to set a maximum depth beyond the default.

### Learning Outcomes:
1. Constructor and destructor logic and functionality
2. Object/Class construction, methods and super class inheritence
3. Pointers/Pointers-to-pointers construction, free store dealocation, decimal types and overflow
